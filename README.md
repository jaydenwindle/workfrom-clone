# Workfrom Clone

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaydenwindle/workfrom-clone/master/workfrom-cover.jpg)

I absolutely love [Workfrom](https://workfrom.co/) and use it in every city that I visit. However, their native apps haven't been updated in over 3 years and are kind of a pain to use.

So, I created my own. It uses the hidden Workfrom API and directs users to the web app for more details.
